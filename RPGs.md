# Dungeons & Dragons

Your typical high fantasy setting where the players are epic adventurers (or on their way to becoming).  Think Lord of the Rings type.

# Fate (Core/Accelerated)

A generic role-playing game system that can be adapted for anything.  It inherently has no setting, and there are even rules to completely co-operatively build the world.  The flexibility that it allows means that many settings have been created that utilise the Fate rules and can be picked up for play.  The main goal as players in Fate based systems is to make the other players be awesome.

# Scum & Villainy

Space.  A fairly light system that focuses on the storytelling and encourages you to push your luck a bit to make interesting things happen.  Can be played everything from a space opera (e.g. Star Wars), to a space western (e.g. Firefly/Cowboy Bebop).  Based on the Forged in the Dark system.

# Shadowrun

Dystopian near future that has elements of cyberpunk and magic.  It has cyberware and bioware (electro-mechanical limbs and bioengineering) as well as magic.  Mega-corps have taken over the world with their corporate dealings.  The players are Shadowrunners, people who run in the shadows were the law is gray.  They can be mercenaries for hire that corps utilise as deniable assets or individuals fighting against the corps.
