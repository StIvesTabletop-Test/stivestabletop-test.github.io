# 3. Personal Data Online

| 3.1 | The Group use several digital tools and social media platforms.  Online communication requires the Committee to obtain and store information about individuals, specifically their name and username/identifier associated with the appropriate tool or platform.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 3.2 | The Committee will invite individuals to provide an email address.  This will be used solely for the purpose of communicating updates on Group events and activities.  These details will be stored within the relevant tool or platform, or within a database.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 3.3 | Any stored contact information will be visible to all members of the Committee and, depending on the digital tool or platform, revealed to other individuals (for example, joining a Facebook Group will reveal the individual to others within that Facebook Group - this is outside the control of the Committee).                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| 3.4 | Individuals are not required to use any digital tool or social media platform, and any such use is also in accordance with the relevant user agreements.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| 3.5 | Individuals may at any time have their details removed from the relevant digital tool, social media platform account, or associated database.  However, depending on the tool or platform, the Committee may not have the ability to fully remove an individual or their contributions (instead the individual might need to make such a request to the tool or platform).  The Committee will acknowledge requests to be removed, and explain the actions taken, and what may remain, on a per tool/platform basis. |

# 4. Data Sharing

| 4.1 | Individuals’ data will not be shared outside the Committee or sold to third parties. |
