# 1. Introduction

| 1.1 | The St. Ives Tabletop group (henceforth referred to as the “Group”) is managed by a committee (henceforth referred to as the “Committee”). |
| 1.2 | The following policy covers families and children at Group events and activities.                                                          |

# 2. Under 16s

| 2.1 | Under 16s are not permitted at Group events or activities.                                                                                                                                                              |
| 2.2 | This is not intended to prohibit individuals with caring responsibilities from attending.  Rather this limits the responsibilities for hosting Committee members and avoids the need to consider child safety concerns. |

# 3. 16 to 18 Year Olds

| 3.1 | 16 to 18 year olds are allowed to attend, but only if accompanied by a guardian who is responsible for their safety.                               |
| 3.2 | 16 to 18 year olds are able to participate in activities and events within the session on their own as long as their guardian is within the venue. |
