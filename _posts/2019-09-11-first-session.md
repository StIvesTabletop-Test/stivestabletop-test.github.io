title: First Session

It was the first session of the St. Ives Tabletop gaming club on the of 11th September and we werenâ€™t sure what to expect.
So it was great to be joined by some new keen gamers and after a little deliberation we worked out how to split up based on peoples games preferences and had 3 tables running.

Ross D. was Gamesmaster for a [Scum and Villainy][SaV] space-themed role playing game, which saw 2 bounty hunters navigate a series of scrapes and chases but eventually successfully catch their targets.

Catherine D. hosted a competitive board games table with a 4-player game of [Carcassonne][Carc], a worker placement game based around the many walled medieval towns of southern France.
This was quickly followed by [Ticket to Ride: Europe][TtRE], a race to grab the necessary and often hotly contested train routes around Europe required to complete the ticket criteria for additional victory points.

Kathy J. hosted a cooperative game of 5-player [Forbidden Island][FI] with some excellent team artefact acquisition then a race to the helicopter against the rapidly rising waters, but the team eventually sank beneath the waves with their ill gotten gains.
Then the table went competitive with a game of [Cleopatra and the Society of Architects][CatSoA] - no one had played before but quickly picked up the marketplace and building mechanic.
However, a couple of players were caught out when the game victory conditions were met earlier than expected and they had a full pyramid of corruption from their use of dodgy building materials.
It sounded like this game might get another play in a future session now some of the subtleties of the gameplay are clearer.

Then we reformed the tables with those who could stay on for a quick final game and gave [Planet][Plan] an outing.
This is a simple game adding magnetic terrain tiles to a planet core with the aim to attract different animals that have different terrain preferences.
At the end of the night thinking about tile placement around a 3D dodecahedron was getting tricky, but everyone enjoyed the novel game format and animal theme.
