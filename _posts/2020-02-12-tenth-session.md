title: Tenth Session - Mars, Mordor and Menageries
---

Nine people turned out despite the cold for this session, including one new member, which included settling on Mars, battling evil to defeat Sauron and building the best zoo.

The session started again with a quick game of [Speed Cups][SC] the colourful cup stacking game.
But we were no match for the hand eye coordination and manual dexterity of Simon and Digger.

After that a 5 person game of [King Domino][KD] with the [Age of Giants][KDAoG] expansion.
Another popular quick game, building a kingdom with domino like tiles featuring 6 different terrains.
The Giant expansion adds some new tiles with giants that prevent scoring from some of your crowns, and footprint tiles that let you move the giants into an opponents kingdom.
Also some endgame special scoring bonus tiles, usually relating to getting terrain tiles in certain locations in your kingdom grid, which gives some variety and additional strategy to the game.

Now that everyone had arrived we split into three tables; [Terraforming Mars][TM], [Lord of the Rings][LOTR] and [Blades in the Dark][BitD].

[Terraforming Mars][TM] is a returning game with Simon "I'm going to have to science the $#%@ out of this" W leading some new players and some repeat colonisers in this complex but engrossing game to settle the red planet.

Meanwhile, Ross D led two players, in the on-going [Blades in the Dark][BitD] campaign. It continued this week with high priest/wizard Wyrm and hunter Flint. (Last time Smook and a new acolyte called Grog were on their own mis-adventure).
It started with a note from the Grey Cloaks faction saying "We know what you did!" and asking to meet. So that they didnt shop us to the city guard we had to get a rival gang out of Twelve Towers and quickly.

We managed to find these rivals in tower 4 and tried a social visit to talk them into moving! Unfortunately this nearly went wrong when Wyrm tried to impress them with a ghost that nearly turned vengeful. Eventually we sort of convinced them to move if we could get the Wraiths (a band of silent assassins) to allow them into the Nightmarket.
Wyrm was not happy at the outcome as he wanted them to join our cult, in fact he thought they would make great sacrifices!
Flint came up with an ambush plan but needed to convince the rivals with a fake Wraith mask.
Unfortunately the Wraiths found out and made us do a job for them!

This was getting very messy! At this point Flint was trailing Wyrm who was carrying the package that the Wraiths wanted us to deliver and noticed an ambush was going to happen on poor Wyrm!
This started a manic chase through the streets of Twelve Towers! Wyrm couldn't run very well due to his bullet wound from last time, so after ducking down an alley, Flint pulled out his fine pistols and let rip, unfortunately killing one of the new gang following. This set off the usual tolling bell for the ghost crew!

The new gang tried to cut us off but Wyrm successfully caused the street electrics to spark  to slow them down (without any damage to us!) So we managed to struggle into a waiting cabbie (horse drawn) only to see the new gang taking over one behind.
Wyrm tried to throw an electroplasm vial but that bounced off the chasing horse and blew up a bystander! Flint  nearly fell off climbing on top, but then shot at the following carriage that made it overturn - movie style. Unfotunately it sort of back-fired as the gang driver was catapulted onto our carriage.
A struggle ensued which was ended by the Wraiths turning up and dispatching the gang members. They thanked us for being bait - the bag was a decoy - and they even decided to let the rival gang of the Grey Cloaks move into Nightmarket!
Wyrm and Flint managed to limp home worse for wear, but then discovered coins in the bag - so it wasnt a complete fiasco after all....

Kathy J led a cooperative 2 player game of [Lord of the Rings][LOTR] a tricky card based game that quite faithfully recreates the events of the book trilogy.
In this session following Frodo and Sam from Bag End through Rivendell, Moria, Lothlorien, Helms Deep, Shelobs lair and finally Mordor.
It can expand to 5 players utilising all 5 hobbits, yes - **five** - hobbits, you can play as ["Fatty" the hobbit that was cut out of the films](https://lotr.fandom.com/wiki/Fredegar_Bolger).
The game was going very well and the 2 hobbits had barely strayed towards the darkness when all the events in the final location turned against them and Sauron claimed "The ring is mine".

As the other 2 tables were still engrossed in their games, Kathy J and Catherine D switched to building zoos in [O Zoo le Mio][Zoo].
A much simpler game with an auction mechanic letting you bid over 5 tiles per round, the tiles feature 2 animal enclosures, trees and paths.
A good selection of tiles addded to your zoo will attract visitors if you have the best mammals, birds, reptiles, primates or sea creatures, and more tokens for the most trees or creation of circular paths.
The game plays over 5 years or rounds and scoring occurs at the end of each year based on the number of tokens in your zoo with scores incrementing each year.
We played 2 games with Villa Gorilla triumphing over Porky Park and then Crocodome more narrowly beating Aqua Shark for the title of most beautiful/successful zoo.

We then finished off with a final 2 player game of [King Domino plus giants][KDAoG] where the kingdom with 3 large areas of lake, forest and fields beat the massive gold mine complex.
