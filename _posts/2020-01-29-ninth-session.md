title: Ninth Session - Heroes, Horrors and Homage
---

A great session even though only 2 committee members could attend, with heroes smiting evil, haunted houses and wonderous civilizations.

This is a very quick summary of what was played, a full blog will be written up next time.

It started with a quick game of 4-player [Speed Cups][SC], where players race to recreate what is depicted on a card with a set of small cups they each have, the first player to do so gets the card. A fast frantic game!

Next it split into three tables. One table of 5-players battling evil in [Sentinels of the Multiverse][S]. Players become a super hero with a deck of special powers and the aim is to co-operate to defeat a chosen super villain.

Another table of 3 attempted [Betrayal at House on the Hill][BHH], in which one player will secretly betray the others. It is a game of exploration laying down tiles and exploring the house until the betrayer has been identified and defeated or the others are lost.

The last table of five played a game of [7 Wonders][7W] which is becoming a firm club favourite. Each player has to build a civilization based on one of the ancient wonders of the world.

During the evening another session of both [Sentinels][S] and [7 Wonders][7W] were played, whilst a three player [Blades in the Dark][BitD] RPG session was conducted.
