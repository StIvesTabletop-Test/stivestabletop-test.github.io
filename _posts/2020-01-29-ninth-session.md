title: Ninth Session - Heroes, Horrors, and Homage
---

This was a great session, even though only 2 committee members could attend, with heroes smiting evil, haunted houses and wonderous civilizations.
This is a very quick summary of what was played - weâ€™ll be back with a full blog as usual for the next session.

The session started with a quick game of 4-player [Speed Cups][SC] led by Simon W., where players race to recreate what is depicted on a card with a set of small, colourful cups they each have.
The first player to do so gets the card and at the end of the game the player with the most cards wins.
A fast and frantic game!

Next we split into 3 tables.
The first table of 5-players battled evil in [Sentinels of the Multiverse][S].
Players each become a different super hero with a deck of special powers and co-operate to defeat a chosen super villain.

Another table of 3 played [Betrayal at House on the Hill][BHH].
This starts as a game of exploration, laying down tiles and exploring the haunted house.
Then one player finds out they are the betrayer with an ulterior motive against the rest of the group.
The betrayer and the rest of the group then battle it out until one stands victorious.

The last table of 5 played a game of [7 Wonders][7W], which is becoming a firm club favourite, led by Ross D.
Each player has to build a civilization based on one of the ancient wonders of the world.

We then rearranged the groups and had second plays of both [Sentinels][S] and [7 Wonders][7W].
Meanwhile, 3 players started a [Blades in the Dark][BitD] RPG session, continuing where the story left off from the previous session.
This looks to be becoming a multi-session campaign, as we build on the story and new players and characters join.
