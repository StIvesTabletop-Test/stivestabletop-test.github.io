title: Twelfth Session - Birds, Skye and Villagers
---

14 attendees this session despite the spring chill, with two games
from last session making a reappearance and some new players learning
them. A lot of games involving villagers, crafting, building or
topically fighting epidemics.

Early arrivals started with a quick game of [For Sale][FS] a two-stage
property acquisition and then sale game. A simple card game with some
nice artwork with properties ranging from a saggy cardboard box to a
space station. Can you use your seed funds to buy a good range of
properties and then predict which real estate your opponents will sell
each round to make the most profit from yours?

We then quickly broke up into three games tables and an RPG continuing
the ongoing [Blades in the Dark][BitD] saga.

Catherine D led a three player game of [Isle of Skye][IoS]. This is a
tile auctioning and placement game with different preset goals per
round played over six rounds developing your clan lands. Completed areas
and trade resources like whisky, sheep and highland cows bring in the
victory points but you need to keep an eye on the rival clans to set
your auction prices right to benefit from or stop them adding certain
tile types to their lands.

Simon W taught another four player group [Eminent Domain][ED]
developing their civilisations through deck building. This week's
group were equally confused by this game at the start, it is a weird
mix of deck building (but not quite like the standard format,
i.e. Dominion, every card you can buy is unique); with some role
selection (a bit like Puerto Rico, more like Race/Roll for the Galaxy
or Glory to Rome); and at its heart is a race game (end the game
quickly, and while you're in the lead). This time all four players
focused on colonising, which accelerated the speed of the game. Scores
are typically low (20-30), so managing to settle that three point
planet in the final turn can make the difference.

Meanwhile Kathy J demonstrated a four player game of [Wingspan][W], a
well designed game with nice artwork and interesting facts about the
birds you are attracting to your reserves. There are a lot of ways to
earn victory points so there is a lot to learn and experiment
with. After a first play to get a feel for that variety and balance it
sounded like we had some more fans wanting to try this game again or
add it to their own collection.  Although it was quite a close game,
in the end it was two largely egg based strategies that did best. The
cowbirds ability to lay eggs during another players eggs phase had
them benefitting nicely from the player that had developed the
grasslands biome (which generates eggs). They were making much use of
that ability and with their sparrow and crow combo, which was
generating lots of eggs and then turning some into food!

Isle of Skye and Eminent Domain finished at a similar time leading to
a table reshuffle and Alex starting a three player game of [Villagers][V]
and Simon and Catherine explaining [Via Nebula][VN] for a four player
game.

[Villagers][V] revolves around attracting skilled refugees travelling
along the nearby road to join your new village. The various skills are
all interlinked so you need to select the right mix of craftspeople
with a range of skills to your village and build on those combinations
to make the village prosperous.

[Via Nebula][VN] is an action point and network building game by the
great (and devisive) Martin Wallace. Each
turn you have two action points to either clear the nearby mists,
explore resources, gather resources, or
build. Mist clearing reveals new production or building sites, but all
players can now use these. Building requires contracts to be completed
and those need resources and transport links, finished contracts
provide unique bonuses. The game ends when a player finishes their
fifth construction. For Martin Wallace fans, there are strands of Age
of Steam (or Steam) flowing through this game, combined with the fixed
set of actions and perform two actions so familiar from many of his
games (Brass, Age of Industry, Study in Emerald, etc). Like Emenient
Domain played earlier, scores in this game are low (15-25 typically),
so every single point matters.

On the RPG table Sean J led a short [Blades in the Dark][BitD]
adventure in the ongoing campaign world. The two available cult members
had a tricky possession problem to solve, [read more about it
here](/Sessions/2020-blades-campaign.html##session-11th-mar---possession). Then
the team tried to take on a [Pandemic][P] trying to cooperatively
eradicate four deadly diseases around the globe. Unfortunately the Asian
red plague and African yellow contagion could not be kept in check
whilst the vaccines were researched.

Once Villagers had finished the table moved onto a three player game
of [7 Wonders][7W] another game seeing quite a steady inclusion in
session action, this being its fourth appearance on the tables.

Finally the remaining four attendees tried their hand at [The
Shipwreck Arcana][SA] a maths based deduction game with a tarot card
art theme. After a good start there were a couple of mistakes and
forced guesses due to cards about to fade leading to the the doom
clock almost advancing to the end. However the final make or break
clue proved distinguishing enough and the correct fate value was
identified leading to a very narrow victory.
