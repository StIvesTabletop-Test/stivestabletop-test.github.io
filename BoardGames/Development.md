# Carcassonne

* 5 minute rules
* 2-5 players
* 45 min play time
* tile placement game
* [Carcassonne BGG link]({{ site.data.BoardGameLinks.Carcassonne.BGGLink }})

A pick and place game with tiles featuring the walled towns, monasteries and farms of the Carcassonne region of France.
A simple game to learn but a lot of strategy in the placement of meeples to score points from the landscape features.

# Dominion{% include new_entry.html %}

* 2-4 players
* 30 min play time
* Card based deck building
* [Dominion BGG link]({{ site.data.BoardGameLinks.Dominion.BGGLink }})

One of the first and best deck building games, Dominion has a medieval theme and a huge selection of card combinations within the base deck and through a host of expansions leading to massive variety between games.

Each player starts with the same deck of 10 cards; 7 copper and 3 estates.
The aim is to acquire the most victory points before an end condition is reached, usually the supply running out of province cards, the maximum victory point card type.

Each turn you draw 5 cards, play action cards following rules on each card and then spend any treasure cards from that hand to buy other cards.
Discard all used cards and once your draw pile is exhausted shuffle the discards to become the new draw pile.
This means your deck is constantly growing and cycling and the aim is to keep the deck balanced and maximise the chances of powerful card combinations drawing in the same turn so your available treasure grows and you can buy the big victory point cards.

There are 10 different action cards available per game from a selection of 25 types in the base game.
Action cards frequently let you chain multiple actions, draw extra cards, swap or rearrange cards, acquire treasure, or attack other players.
So you can try and build a "card engine" that lets you cycle through most of your deck in one turn to access all your treasure or you can try and streamline your deck and convert lower denomination treasures into higher ones so you draw more treasure from fewer cards.
Very satisfying when your strategy pays off and frustrating when you are 1 coin short of that final province!

# Settlers of Catan

* 3-4 players
* 60 min play time
* board game
* [Settlers of Catan BGG link]({{ site.data.BoardGameLinks.SettlersOfCatan.BGGLink }})

An island is generated from hexagonal tiles so every game is different.
You need to connect and develop your towns using natural resources which are generated by rolling two dice each turn.
The numbers 2-12 are linked to each land based hex tile.
The twist is some numbers and hence some resources are more common than others and you gain resources depending on which numbered tiles your towns border.
You need to balance your resources based on your key incomes and trade for what you are missing.
