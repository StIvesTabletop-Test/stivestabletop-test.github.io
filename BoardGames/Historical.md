Develop one of the 7 Wonders of the ancient world over 3 Ages.
You need to balance collecting building resources against the different methods of scoring victory points;
military, treasury, Wonders, civilian structures, science, commerce and guilds.
A simple game mechanic, each age you start with a hand of 7 cards.
Choose a card that you can play by either having the resources, buying the resources from your neighbours or having a construction chain from previous cards.
Then pass the hand on.
Continue until the hands are depleted, which triggers an end of age military scoring round and then start the next age with a new hand.
However the challenge and re-playability comes from the selection of those cards to build victory points or stop the competing Wonders from getting them.
