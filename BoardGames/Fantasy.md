# Kingdomino

* 2-4 players
* 20 min play time
* domino tile mechanic with tile drafting
* [Kingdomino BGG link]({{ site.data.BoardGameLinks.Kingdomino.BGGLink }})

Build a kingdom out of domino tiles that feature 6 terrain types. Players use a simple drafting mechanic to select the domino tile they will place
in the next round. Score points at the end of the game based on consecutive terrain types and tile placement to create a 5x5 grid with your castle
ideally in the centre.

# Rock Paper Wizard

* 5 minute rules
* 3-6 players
* 30 min play time
* card game
* [Rock Paper Wizard BGG link]({{ site.data.BoardGameLinks.RockPaperWizard.BGGLink }})

A short game where adventurers fight to divide the loot using a shared spellbook. Each round players choose a spell and simultaneously make the hand gesture for the spell towards its player target. Then resolve the ensuing chaos of success or spell reversals until the loot has been divided. A fun take on D&D whilst waiting for the main session to start.
