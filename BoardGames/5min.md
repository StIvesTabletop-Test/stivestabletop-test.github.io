# Planet

* 2-4 players
* 30 min play time
* 3D magnetic pieces
* [Planet BGG link](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/252929/planet)

Each player receives a planet core which is a magnetic dodecahedron (12 faces) and on each round they choose and add a terrain tile.
Terrain tiles are pentagons consisting of 5 triangles of various combinations of sea, mountain, ice, forest or desert.
Each round you try to attract animals to your planet by making it the most favourable to them based on their preferred terrain conditions, for instance the largest forest touching desert, the largest ocean not touching ice or the most discrete areas of mountain.
You can see which animals (randomly selected each game) are available in future rounds and can try to plan ahead but it is quite fiendish trying to keep track of all the areas and interactions around a 3D shape.
At the end score points dependent on animal types attracted and a secret terrain related mission.
