You command a team of archeologists plundering the forest temples of the ancient city of Tikal in Guatemala.
Each turn you have 10 action points to spend on exploring, uncovering temples, digging up artefacts and deploying your team to protect your temples.
Using a random volcano mechanic scoring rounds are triggered through the game, score is determined by the size of the temples you control and sets of artefacts discovered.
A tactical game of cut-throat archeology.
