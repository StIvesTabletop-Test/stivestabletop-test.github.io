# Forbidden Island

* 2-4 players
* 30 minutes play time
* board game with card deck mechanic
* [Forbidden Island BGG link]({{ site.data.BoardGameLinks.ForbiddenIsland.BGGLink }})

It is a race against the rising floodwaters for your team of treasure hunters to acquire the four artefacts and make it back to the helicopter.
After each turn a card deck controls the rising flood in a similar way to Pandemic so you can determine which areas of the island are the most likely to submerge first.

# Diamant/Incan Gold

* 3-8 players
* 20 minutes play time
* card game
* [Diamant/Incan Gold BGG link]({{ site.data.BoardGameLinks.Diamant.BGGLink }})

A push your luck game, the further you venture into the temple the more treasure you can acquire but also more chance of being caught in a trap and getting nothing.

# Magic Maze

* 5 minute rules
* co-op
* 1-8 players
* 15 minutes play time
* board game
* [Magic Maze BGG link]({{ site.data.BoardGameLinks.MagicMaze.BGGLink }})

Your team of adventurers needs to explore and locate 4 shops in the magic shopping mall, rob them (equipment for your next adventure) and escape.
The catch;
Players canâ€™t talk and each player only controls a subset of the adventurer actions.
A cooperative heist game with a difference.

# Relic Runners{% include new_entry.html %}

* 2-5 players
* 60 minutes play time
* board game - route building and set collection
* [Relic Runners BGG link]({{ site.data.BoardGameLinks.RelicRunners.BGGLink }})

Colourful archeologists, not at all based on characters from popular tomb thieving movie franchises, are on a mission to loot the hidden temples of a long lost jungle.
Gameplay is all about building paths through the jungle by placing markers. You can travel along any route in your turn providing there is only 1 segment that is unknown to you.
Development of routes requires collecting toolboxes to grant extra powers like adding or rearranging your markers.
If you reach a temple you can uncover a layer, different temple types have different types of bonus.
When a temple is completely uncovered an artefact is revealed and to collect this you need to run a valid route between 2 completed temples of the same colour.
Victory points are based on bonuses from temple layers, artefacts collected and length of the run to collect the artefact. A light hearted theme making it a fun family game but one with quite a bit of depth to the mechanics for more seasoned gamers.

# Robinson Crusoe: Adventures on the Cursed Island{% include new_entry.html %}

* 1-4 players
* 120 minutes play time
* co-op
* card and board game
* [Robinson Crusoe BGG link]({{ site.data.BoardGameLinks.RobinsonCrusoe.BGGLink }})

Renowned for being particularly difficult this co-operative game has a number of scenarios all based around a team of adventurers surviving on an isolated and very dangerous island.
Each adventurer has a slightly different skill set, Explorer, Cook, Soldier and Carpenter and making full use of these skills is vital to finding enough food and shelter to survive each night and trying to achieve the scenario objective.
Meanwhile the island will be throwing all sorts of challenges at the team including dangerous animals, accidents, cursed items, unfriendly natives and increasingly inclement weather.
Gratifying when the team survives, frustrating when a final trivial sounding event like "Otters" is the end of the expedition.

# Tikal

* 2-4 players
* 90 minutes play time
* board game
* [Tikal BGG link]({{ site.data.BoardGameLinks.Tikal.BGGLink }})

You command a team of archaeologists plundering the forest temples of the ancient city of Tikal in Guatemala.
Each turn you have 10 action points to spend on exploring, uncovering temples, digging up artefacts and deploying your team to protect your temples.
Using a random volcano mechanic scoring rounds are triggered through the game, score is determined by the size of the temples you control and sets of artefacts discovered.
A tactical game of cut-throat archaeology.

# Unlock{% include new_entry.html %}

* any players (that fit round the table)
* 60 minutes play time
* co-op
* card and app based game
* [Unlock (Heroic Adventures version) BGG link]({{ site.data.BoardGameLinks.UnlockHeroicAdventures.BGGLink }})

Unlock! is a co-operative card game inspired by escape rooms that uses a simple system which allows you to search scenes, combine objects, and solve riddles.
Each Unlock! box contains 3 games with a variety of themes and an increasing difficulty level and there are now a number of versions to buy and some to print and play.
Each individual game we have tried (5 so far) has been very different with a wide variety of puzzles, from spotting hidden clues on the cards and solving fiendish codes to using the app to interact with the cards in different ways or even merging the cards to build bigger scenes or going 3D with them.
