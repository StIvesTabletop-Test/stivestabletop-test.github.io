# Forbidden Island

* 2-4 players
* 30 min play time
* board game with card deck mechanic
* [Forbidden Island BGG link]({{ site.data.BoardGameLinks.ForbiddenIsland.BGGLink }})

It is a race against the rising floodwaters for your team of treasure hunters to acquire the four artefacts and make it back to the helicopter.
After each turn a card deck controls the rising flood in a similar way to Pandemic so you can determine which areas of the island are the most likely to submerge first.

# Diamant/Incan Gold

* 3-8 players
* 20 min play time
* card game
* [Diamant/Incan Gold BGG link]({{ site.data.BoardGameLinks.Diamant.BGGLink }})

# Magic Maze

* 5 minute rules
* co-op
* 1-8 players
* 15 min play time
* board game
* [Magic Maze BGG link]({{ site.data.BoardGameLinks.MagicMaze.BGGLink }})

Your team of adventurers needs to explore and locate 4 shops in the magic shopping mall, rob them (equipment for your next adventure) and escape.
The catch;
Players canâ€™t talk and each player only controls a subset of the adventurer actions.
A cooperative heist game with a difference.

# Tikal

* 2-4 players
* 90 min play time
* board game
* [Tikal BGG link]({{ site.data.BoardGameLinks.Tikal.BGGLink }})

You command a team of archaeologists plundering the forest temples of the ancient city of Tikal in Guatemala.
Each turn you have 10 action points to spend on exploring, uncovering temples, digging up artefacts and deploying your team to protect your temples.
Using a random volcano mechanic scoring rounds are triggered through the game, score is determined by the size of the temples you control and sets of artefacts discovered.
A tactical game of cut-throat archaeology.
