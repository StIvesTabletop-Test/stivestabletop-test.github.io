You are running a hospital were the patients are dice and their health is indicated by the uppermost face value, 1 is near death but boost them to above 6 and you can discharge them for reputation points.
Played over 8 rounds, each round 3 new dice patients arrive filling up your wards but you get to upgrade your hospital by adding a new ward or staff specialist.
The strategy comes from the decisions over how best to build and use the hospital resources and which dice to heal and which need to be neglected.
