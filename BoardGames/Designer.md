title: Board Games by Designer

# Intro

This page organises games by designer, and provides links to the theme pages.

It would be unfair to characterise any designer as a one-hit-wonder, but there are a few designers (and artists) that have become “household names” in board gaming.
Here we list a few of these designers we play at the club.

(It is not without some shame for our hobby that we note the gender bias in this list).

# Alan R. Moon

* [Incan Gold]({{ site.data.BoardGameLinks.Diamant.Link }})
* [Ticket to Ride]({{ site.data.BoardGameLinks.TicketToRideEurope.Link }})
