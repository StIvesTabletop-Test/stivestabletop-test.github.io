title: Board Games by Designer

# Intro

This page organises games by designer, and provides links to the theme pages.

It would be unfair to characterise any designer as a one-hit-wonder,
but there are a few designers (and artists) that have become
"household names" in boardgaming. Here we list a few of these
designers we play at the club.

(It is not without some shame for our hobby that we note the gender
bias in this list)

# Martin Wallace

* [P.I.]({{ site.data.BoardGameLinks.PI.Link }}).
* [Via Nebula]({{ site.data.BoardGameLinks.ViaNebula.Link }}).

# Alan R. Moon

* More will follow at the club, almost certainly.
