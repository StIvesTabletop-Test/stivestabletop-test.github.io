# Settlers of Catan

* 3-4 players
* 60 min play time
* board game
* [Settlers of Catan BGG link](https://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/13/catan)

An island is generated from hexagonal tiles so every game is different.
You need to connect and develop your towns using natural resources which are generated by rolling two dice each turn.
The numbers 2-12 are linked to each land based hex tile.
The twist is some numbers and hence some resources are more common than others and you gain resources depending on which numbered tiles your
towns border. You need to balance your resources based on your key incomes and trade for what you are missing.
