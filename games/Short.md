Your team of adventurers needs to explore and locate 4 shops in the magic shopping mall, rob them (equipment for your next adventure) and escape. The catch; players can't talk and each player only controls a subset of the adventurer actions. A cooperative heist game with a difference.

Animal martial artists compete in ninja training to determine the best pupil. The cards are arranged in an 8x6 grid, you select your start card in the grid and on your turn use the various ninja skills to move to the next card and take the card you just vacated. This leaves holes in the grid setup limiting future moves for you and your opponents, gives you a new card skill to play in a future move and ultimately your ninja score.
