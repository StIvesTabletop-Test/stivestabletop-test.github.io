Catherine’s all time favourite board game is [Caverna](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/102794/caverna-cave-farmers).  She also has a soft spot for board games by [Martin Wallace](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgamedesigner/6/martin-wallace), such as [Via Nebula](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/191231/nebula) and [P.I.](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/129050/pi).  She’s always on the look out for games with beautiful artwork and/or nature themes, including some of her other favourites - [Tokaido](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/123540/tokaido), [Wingspan](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/266192/wingspan), [Gùgōng](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/250458/gugng), and [Takenoko](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/70919/takenoko).

# Kathy J.

![Kathy J.](/images/committee/KathyJ.jpg){:class="img_committee"}

Kathy generally prefers co-op games, especially [Pandemic](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/30549/pandemic).
But she can’t resist [Ticket to Ride](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/14996/ticket-ride-europe),
[Tikal](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/54/tikal), [Magical Athlete](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/24565/magical-athlete) or 
[Braggart](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/72420/braggart).
Kathy has been our main reviewer on the website, so you have a fair idea from what she’s been reviewing!

# Ross D.

![Ross D.](/images/committee/RossD.jpg){:class="img_committee"}

Ross started his geekvangelism with [Arkham Horror](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/15987/arkham-horror) and [Dominion](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/36218/dominion) (which are still some of his favourites).  He loves co-operative games and now he loves [XCOM](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/163602/xcom-board-game), [Spirit Island](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/162886/spirit-island), [Aeon’s End](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/191189/aeons-end), and [Sentinels of the Multiverse](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/102652/sentinels-multiverse).  When he remembers that he should play some competitive games, he plays [Caverna](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/102794/caverna-cave-farmers), [Dungeon Petz](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/97207/dungeon-petz) (he loves the artwork on this one), and [Isle of Skye](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/176494/isle-skye-chieftain-king).

He absolutely loves playing RPGs, the reason he’s helping with the club is to give other people a chance to start.  He has a varied background and plays everything from [Dungeons & Dragons (4th ed.)](https://www.rpggeek.com/rpg/190/dungeons-dragons-4th-edition), [Shadowrun (5th ed.)](https://www.rpggeek.com/rpg/21069/shadowrun-5th-edition), and [Fate](https://www.rpggeek.com/rpgsystem/26506/fate-core).  He’s also currently learning to run others for more variety to teach at the club, including [Blades in the Dark](https://www.rpggeek.com/rpg/26952/blades-dark), [Scum and Villainy](https://www.rpggeek.com/rpg/48736/scum-and-villainy), Sentinels Comics RPG, and [Carbon 2185](https://www.rpggeek.com/rpg/56987/carbon-2185).

# Simon W.

![Simon W.](/images/committee/SimonW.jpg){:class="img_committee"}

Simon owns a few games and will evade picking a favourite - it so depends on the mood and group.  Though he'll often suggest [Telestrations](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/46213/telestrations), [Hossa!](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/2734/hossa), [Turn the Tide](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/1403/turn-tide), [P.I.](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/129050/pi), [Flamme Rouge](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/199478/flamme-rouge), [Edo](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/113636/edo), [Caylus](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/18602/caylus), [Antiquity](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/13122/antiquity), [Eldritch Horror](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/146021/eldritch-horror), [Keyflower](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/122515/keyflower), [Graenaland](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/24843/graenaland), or [Roads & Boats](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/875/roads-boats); four hours is a general limit for a game, so no [18xx](https://boardgamegeek.com/wiki/page/18xx) or the like here.  He was a serious [GURPs](https://www.rpggeek.com/rpgfamily/333/gurps) and [Ars Magica](https://www.rpggeek.com/rpgfamily/1029/ars-magica) fan in the past, now more in love with [Fate](https://www.rpggeek.com/rpgsystem/26506/fate-core).
