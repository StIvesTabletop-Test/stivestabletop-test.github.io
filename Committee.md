Simon owns a few games and will evade picking a favourite - it so depends on the mood and group.  Though he'll often suggest [Telestrations](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/46213/telestrations), [Hossa!](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/2734/hossa), [Turn the Tide](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/1403/turn-tide), [P.I.](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/129050/pi), [Flamme Rouge](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/199478/flamme-rouge), [Edo](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/113636/edo), [Caylus](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/18602/caylus), [Antiquity](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/13122/antiquity), [Eldritch Horror](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/146021/eldritch-horror), [Keyflower](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/122515/keyflower), [Graenaland](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/24843/graenaland), or [Roads & Boats](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/875/roads-boats); four hours is a general limit for a game, so no [18xx](https://boardgamegeek.com/wiki/page/18xx) or the like here.  He was a serious [GURPs](https://www.rpggeek.com/rpgfamily/333/gurps) and [Ars Magica](https://www.rpggeek.com/rpgfamily/1029/ars-magica) fan in the past, now more in love with [Fate](https://www.rpggeek.com/rpgsystem/26506/fate-core).
