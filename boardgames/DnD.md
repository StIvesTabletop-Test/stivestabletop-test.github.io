A short game where adventurers fight to divide the loot using a shared spellbook. Each round players choose a spell and simultaneously make the hand gesture for the spell towards its player target. Then resolve the ensuing chaos of success or spell reversals until the loot has been divided. A fun take on D&D whilst waiting for the main session to start.

A light introduction to D&D. The game comes with dungeon tiles, figurines, pre-designed characters and scenarios. Simplified rules for exploration and combat let you get into the action quickly. There is a level of character customisation through initial power selections and some character progression as you gain experience. Plenty of player designed downloadable additional content available.
